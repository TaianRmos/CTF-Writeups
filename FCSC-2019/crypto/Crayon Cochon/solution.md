# Solution to Crayon Cochon

This challenge isn't really a crypto challenge. It's just an image with a message written using the PigPen code (Freemasons code).

You can use a paper and a pen to do it, or just use an online tool to solve the challenge:

`BELOW IS THE FLAG KFNOKBHDBLEBSVJMRXKYOXDQZAEAH`

Just be careful because a lot of variations of the grid exists, so you'll maybe have to try a few before finding the right one.
